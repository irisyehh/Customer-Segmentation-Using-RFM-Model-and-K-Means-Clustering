## Customer Segmentation Using RFM Model and K-Means Clustering

### About Project:
此專案係採用一間位於英國的非實體零售商，於2010/12/1至2011/12/9間的所有交易進行客戶分群。
將原始數據採用RFM模型提出的三個客戶消費行為指標( Recency-Frequency-Monetary )整理並以四分位數重新配分，最後利用K-Means進行聚類分析。
目標協助公司區分客戶類型及其比重，進而提出分眾客戶經營提案。

In this project, I will conduct an unsupervised clustering analysis on transaction records from a UK-based non-store retailer, covering the period from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011. Customer segmentation involves grouping customers based on similarities within each cluster. By dividing customers into distinct segments, we can enhance the understanding of each customer's value to the business. The ultimate goal is to help the company identify different customer types and their proportions, thereby enabling the development of targeted customer management strategies.
